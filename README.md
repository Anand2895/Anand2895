## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- King County Regression (https://github.com/Anand2895/King_County_Regression): This endeavor is driven by the desire to build a robust model capable of accurately estimating property prices. Such a model has practical implications for both buyers and sellers, enabling them to make well-informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of property valuation.

- Delhi/NCR Vegetable Market Analysis (https://github.com/Anand2895/Vegetable_Market_Analysis)
